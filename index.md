**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic I explored this quarter was the use of Otter Grader for automated assessment and reproducible evaluation in educational coding environments. Unlike static assignments, Otter Grader introduces a layer of immediate feedback and standardization that mirrors real-world data science workflows. I found it fascinating how such a system not only automates grading but also enforces best practices in testing, documentation, and reproducible computation. Experimenting with Otter Grader gave me insight into how automation can enhance both teaching efficiency and student learning, making assessment a more interactive and reflective process rather than a purely administrative task.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
For my Quarter 2 Project, I would like to conduct an empirical investigation that measures the learning impact of the simulation-based CLT exercises developed in Quarter 1. By collecting data from two groups of DSC 10 students—one completing traditional problem sets and another using my interactive coding modules—I plan to compare their performance and conceptual understanding through a controlled classroom experiment. The analysis will focus on whether simulation-driven instruction improves accuracy, engagement, and confidence when interpreting sampling distributions.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change I would make to my Quarter 1 approach is to incorporate more structured formative feedback within the coding environment. While my current exercises provide visualization and autograding, I would like to add intermediate reflection prompts that encourage students to explain observed patterns before proceeding to the next step. This adjustment would align even more closely with communication-focused pedagogy and help students consolidate conceptual understanding as they work through simulations.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
In the future, I would like to incorporate modern front-end web technologies to create dynamic visual simulations that make probabilistic concepts more tangible for learners. While coding exercises are intellectually rigorous and promote active engagement, they can still feel abstract to many students. By designing interactive animations—such as sampling distributions evolving in real time or the gradual formation of the normal curve—I aim to bridge the gap between code and intuition. Using frameworks like D3.js or React-based visualization libraries, I could develop browser-based modules that accompany the programming exercises, allowing students to see the Central Limit Theorem “in motion.” This combination of computation and visual storytelling would make the learning experience more accessible, memorable, and conceptually grounded.
